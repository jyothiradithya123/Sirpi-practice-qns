The system should support different types of users (Students, Professors) and different types of books (Physical books, E-books). The system should also ensure data security by preventing unauthorized access to certain attributes.\n",
        "# Requirements:\n",
        "# 1.\tImplement a Book class with details like title, author, isbn, and availability_status.\n",
        "# 2.\tImplement a User class that holds name and user_type (either \"Student\" or \"Professor\").\n",
        "# 3.\tUse Inheritance to create specialized user types (Student, Professor) with different borrowing limits.\n",
        "# 4.\tUse Encapsulation to ensure that certain data (like the number of copies available) is not modified directly.\n",
        "# 5.\tUse Polymorphism to allow different types of books (e.g., PhysicalBook and EBook) to implement a common method for checking availability.\n",
